# Assignment

Please do the same program as in the last assignment, but this time using:

- string class
- STL/class library container (vector, list, queue, ...)
- <algorithm>

You are free to choose the classes you use. One container is sufficient.

Please add some time measurement (you need 1000s of lines to see real numbers)

Best do measurements of the times for reading/sorting/writing separately.

Compare the times

- on different platforms (e.g. your own computer, lab computer, ...)
- the classical solution of last assignment and this one

Please describe the results and if those fit your expectations.

Please submit the full sources of both solutions (classical and with string/container) and a short result explanation report. The report should contain the times measured and a statement if the result fits to your expectations and why/why not.

Please keep the deadline.

# Solution

The solution is done with Visual Studio.
